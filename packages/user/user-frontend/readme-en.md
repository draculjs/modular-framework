## Main FRONTEND imports

<br>

The project paths must be merged with those of the module to have access to all the views:

*apps/frontend/src/router/routes.js*

    import {routes as userRoutes} from '@dracul/user-frontend'

<br>

The messages of the project must be merged with those of the module to have access to all translations:

*apps/frontend/src/i18n/index.js*

    import {i18nMessages as i18nMessagesUser} from '@dracul/user-frontend'

<br>

GraphQL must be initialized with apolloClient to make use of the module's queries:

*apps/frontend/src/main.js*

    import { setGraphQlClientToProviders } from "@dracul/user-frontend";

    setGraphQlClientToProviders(apolloClient);


<br>

Use of the module store together with the project store:

*apps/frontend/src/store/index.js*

    import {UserModuleStore} from '@dracul/user-frontend'

    import createPersistedState from "vuex-persistedstate";

    export default new Vuex.Store({
    modules:{
        user: UserModuleStore,
        ...
    },
    plugins: [
        createPersistedState({
            key: process.env.VUE_APP_KEY,
            paths: ['user'],
            reducer: state => (
                {
                user: {
                    access_token: state.user.access_token,
                    me: state.user.me
                },

# User session functionalities

<br>

In this section we will detail the different functionalities for the configuration, creation and edition of the own user in the platform.

### Access component

The component to access this functionality is the **AppBarUserMenu**, which shows, where it is located, access to the login in case of not having logged in or access to user configuration in case of being logged in. 

    import {AppBarUserMenu} from '@dracul/user-frontend'

----
## Log in

To access all the functionalities of the tool, you must log in with your user data.

In case of not having a user see the [*User registration*](#user-registration) section.

When accessing the platform, the first screen will ask for your username and password, the two that you should have previously created. On this screen you must complete the data and press the start session button to enter all the functionalities of the tool.

In case of not remembering the password, see the [*Recover password*](#recover-password) section.

## Sign off

Once the user experience is finished, the session must be closed. This is important to protect personal information and prevent people other than the user from entering the platform.

For this you must click on the user's avatar in the upper right corner of the screen where the information of the logged in user and the options to visit your profile and log out will be displayed:
~~~~
user
user@domain.com
-------------------
Profile
Sign off
~~~~
By clicking on the last, the session will be closed.

-----
## User registration

This functionality will be accessed the first time the platform is used. It is found below the login as: *"Still dont have a user? Sign up"*. By clicking on this link you can access the user registration screen.

To register a new user, a series of data is requested:
- Name
- Lastname
- Email
- Password
- Phone

<br>

These are all mandatory except for the phone number. After completing this form you must click on *Sign up*, and, if all the information is valid, you will be redirected to a screen where a registration completed message will appear, along side with the email address to which you are sent the confirmation for the userÂ´s activation.<br><br>


## User activation

You must enter to the email provided in the user registration and look for the email from **loquesaea@sondeos.com.ar**, in which you will be asked to confirm that you have created the user, after doing so you will be redirected to the CRM page and the user will be successfully created.

----

## Recover password

This instance is designed in case you already have a user on the platform but do not remember the login password.

To recover the password you must click on the phrase *"Forgot your password?"* That is under the login button on the login screen. By doing this you will be redirected to a password recovery screen where you will be asked for the email with which you initially registered on the platform, to which we will send you the instructions to recover your password.


## Change Password

If at any point it is decided to change the user password, be it for convenience or security, or another reason, you must enter the user profile and select that option.

To do this you must first log in. Once on the main screen, look for the avatar in the upper right corner, click and from the drop-down that appears select the option *"Profile"*. Then a box will be displayed with the user's data (Name, Email and Telephone), and underneath a `Recover password` button, which must be clicked to advance. When you click on this button, a form will appear that will first request the current password to allow the password change and below the new password with the confirmation of it. The form must be completed and sent to finalize the modification.

-----
## Change avatar

The avatar, being this a graphic representation or image that is associated with a user on the platform, must be chosen once the user has been confirmed, since it is not requested during the creation of the same.

To do this you must first log in. Once on the main screen, look for the avatar in the upper right corner, click and from the drop-down that appears select the option * "Profile" *. Then a box will be displayed with the user's data (Name, Email and Telephone), headed by a predetermined image, in order to modify this image, you must click it, this will open the computer explorer, from where you have to choose the image that will be your new avatar.
